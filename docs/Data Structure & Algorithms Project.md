# Data Structure & Algorithms Series
created on: 2022-07-31 16:17

### Objectives
___
The series structure is inspired by Jay Wengrow's book - A Common-Sense guide to Data Structure and Algorithms. Which is outlined as follows:

- Chapter 1: Why DS are important?
- Chapter 2: Why Algorithms are important?
- Chapter 3, 4, 5: Big O and using it as a metric to optimize algorithms worst case runtime
- Chapter 6: Beyond optimizing for the worst case
- Chapter 7: Hash Tables
- Chapter 8: Stacks and Queues
- Chapter 9, 10: Recursion
- Chapter 11: Node-based data structures
- Chapter 12: Binary Trees
- Chapter 13: Graphs
- Chapter 14: Space Constraints

To cover all the topics discussed in the books, we'll cover its table of content into chunks, each chunk will be presented in a series of videos.

The first series would cover the following components:
- Big O notation
	- What is it used for and why do we use it?
	- It's usefulness as a tool and using it to optimize algorithms
	- We'll visualize big O on basic chunks of code (for loops, conditionals, etc.)
- Recursion
	- An introduction to recursion.
	- Why is it useful and why do we use it?
	- Back to Big O in the context of recursion.
- Sorting Algorithms
	- Applications of sorting algorithms and why do we need them.
	- Go over the algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, selection sort
		- Implementation in code .
		- Analyzing their performance using Big O.
- Project
	- The final project would be a live stream where we create a web app that enables the user to select a sorting algorithm and visualize it online, similar to this [project](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting). 


| Project     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Visualizng Searching Algorithms      | In this project we will create and host a web app that enables the user to visualize the most popular searching algorithms, namely the bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort

### Estimated delivery time:
| Component | Delivery Time | Total Duration of Component Videos | Number of videos|
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|Big O Notation|1 week|2 hours|around 10 videos|
|Recursion|1 week|2 hours|around 5 videos|
|Sorting Algorithms|2 weeks|10 hours|around 10 videos|
|Project|1 week|4 hours|single video stream|
